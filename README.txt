### Mental Health Service Model ###
This repository is an early work-in-progress!

The aim is to create a mental health service capacity-and-demand forecasting tool tht simulates patients with various characteristics occupying beds in a inpatient wards.

There are four components to the plan:
- Data synthesis: Synthetic patient data will be created with various correlations and characteristics for testing purposes.
- Patient clustering: Several clustering algorithms are tested. These clusters will be used to define patient groups for the model.
- Forecast model: A SimPy discrete simulation model will be developed to handle the forecasting process, including random generation of new referrals, patient characteristics, and ward assignments.
- Analysis tools: A suite of tools for outputting simulation results, and a set of visualisations.
