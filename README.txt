### Mental Health Service Model ###
This repository is a very early work-in-progress!

The aim is to create a mental health service capacity-and-demand forecasting tool.

This repository will contain three parts.
- Data synthesis: Synthetic patient data will be created with various correlations and characteristics for testing.
- Patient clustering: An unsupervised clustering algorithm will be used to identify patient groups for modelling.
- Forecast model: A SimPy model will be developed to handle forecasting.
