### Mental Health Service Model ###
This project is a work-in-progress!

The aim is to create an inpatient health service capacity-and-demand forecasting tool that simulates patients with various characteristics occupying beds in inpatient wards.

There are three components to the project:
- Data synthesis: Synthetic patient data will be created with various correlations and characteristics for testing purposes.
- Forecast model: A SimPy discrete simulation model will be developed to handle the forecasting process, including random generation of new referrals according to derived clusters.
- Analysis tools: A suite of tools for outputting simulation results, and a set of visualisations.
