### Mental Health Service Model ###
This repository is a very early work-in-progress!

The aim is to create a mental health service capacity-and-demand forecasting tool.

This repository will contain three parts.
- Data synthesis: Synthetic patient data will be created with various correlations and characteristics for testing.
- Patient clustering: Several clustering algorithms (likely including k-means, DBSCAN & Agglomerative) will be tested for use in identifying patient groups for modelling.
- Forecast model: A SimPy discrete simulation model will be developed to handle the forecasting process.
